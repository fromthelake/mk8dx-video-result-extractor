# Project Structure

This document explains the code layout in human terms.

## Big Picture

The project has two main phases:

1. Find the right screenshots inside the video
2. Read those screenshots and turn them into structured results

## Entry Points

- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/`
  - real application package
  - contains the implementation modules that power the packaged CLI
- `pyproject.toml`
  - defines the packaged `mk8-local-play` command

## Extraction Modules

- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/extract_frames.py`
  - extraction orchestrator
  - loads videos, scales the image, coordinates detection, and writes extracted frames
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/extract_initial_scan.py`
  - fast first scan over the video
  - looks for three anchor screens:
    - score screen
    - track-name screen
    - race-number screen
  - uses the left-side row-box position prefix as the real score trigger
  - can locally confirm borderline score candidates with a narrow offset search
  - race-number detection supports both the legacy and Dutch template/ROI variants
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/extract_score_screen_selection.py`
  - takes rough score detections and chooses the best race-score and total-score frames
  - expands RaceScore bundles when a real 12th-place template is seen
  - confirms TotalScore only after a sustained score-signal drop, with tie-aware rank acceptance for rows `1..6`
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/extract_video_io.py`
  - shared helpers for frame reads, seeks, and export metadata
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/extract_common.py`
  - shared extraction utilities such as scaling, cropping, template matching, and GPU/runtime helpers

## OCR Modules

- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/extract_text.py`
  - OCR/export orchestrator
  - groups screenshots into races and coordinates the OCR pipeline
  - runs player-level character-family refinement with aligned alpha-cutout color scoring before the Mii fallback
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/ocr_scoreboard_consensus.py`
  - reads several nearby score frames
  - combines them into one best guess
  - maps race-score rows to total-score rows
  - performs the main aligned alpha-cutout character template matching
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/ocr_name_matching.py`
  - fuzzy matching for noisy OCR player names across races
  - chooses a canonical player spelling for each row history
  - resolves duplicate-name identity chains and only marks the truly ambiguous final rows
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/ocr_session_validation.py`
  - computes running totals
  - detects likely new sessions inside one source video
  - flags rows that need manual review
  - recomputes `Position After Race` from validated totals with stable tie-breaks
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/ocr_export.py`
  - writes the final workbook
  - builds the user-facing OCR completion summary
  - reports player-count and identity-split investigation summaries
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/ocr_common.py`
  - shared OCR frame and metadata helpers

## Runtime And Configuration

- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/app_runtime.py`
  - loads `config/app_config.json`
  - checks runtime dependencies
  - detects OpenCV GPU/OpenCL availability
- `config/app_config.json`
  - tracked runtime config used by setup and local runs
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/console_logging.py`
  - consistent operator-style logging and resource reporting

## Game Catalog

- `database/firestore-export.json`
  - local source export used to derive the compact catalog
- `reference_data/game_catalog.json`
  - single source of truth for cups, tracks, and characters
- `tools/build_game_catalog.py`
  - rebuilds the compact catalog from the Firestore export
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/game_catalog.py`
  - loader around the compact catalog
- `mk8dx_video_result_extractor/track_metadata.py`
  - compatibility wrapper for existing track tuple consumers

## Naming Rules Used In The Codebase

The project now tries to follow these rules:

- file names describe what the file does
- module names describe a domain, not an implementation accident
- terms like `initial scan` are preferred over vague labels like `pass1`
- comments explain intent and tradeoffs, not obvious syntax

That means a junior developer should be able to answer:
- what phase is this file responsible for
- what inputs it reads
- what outputs it produces
- why the logic exists
